    <h2>Step 1: Login</h2>

    <p>This is the initial step, where we select to login, and where scope defines which claims will be included in our identity-token.</p>

    <p>A 'claim' is metadata about a user, i.e. typically a client will request access to the user 'profile', i.e. request a token with the scope 'profile'. See <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes">OIDC Scopes</a> for a list of standardized scopes. Some typical scopes are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>openid - indicates that this is an OpenID request. Needed for ID-tokens to be issued.</li>
      <li>profile - covers grants such as 'name' and 'birthdate'</li>
      <li>address</li>
      <li>email</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Scopes are translated into 'claims' in the ID-token, i.e. metadata that the identity provider asserts are valid. See <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#StandardClaims">OIDC Claims</a> for a list of claims</p>

    <p>This client identify itself as '<b>{{client_id}}</b>'. You will see this ID in the following login screen.</p>

    <p>The client is configured with OIDC_ISSUER_URL=<b>{{oidc_issuer_url}}</b>. This is the authorization endpoint of the identity-provider which the client trusts for managing identities.</p>
